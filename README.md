# Gormory

## The Go to Armory

Gormory is a Django and Vue 3 based project and also using Godot, the game engine as a client.

## Features

- Basic login with JWT auth
- Basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on various platform e.g. Listing and delete on Vue, but creating items in the game.

## Tech

The following of Gormory uses for:

### Backend

- [Django] - Python Backend framework
- [DRF] - Rest framework for Django
- [SQLite] - Coming with Django as default SQL Database. It's a TODO to migrate into [PostgreSQL] or [MongoDB]
- [GraphQL] - Query language for searching data fast as a Frontend dev
- [Swagger] - For easily readable API endpoints

### Frontend

- [Vue3] - Best JS Framework, in my opinion!
- [Vite] - Build tool which coming with Vue 3
- [Tailwind CSS] - Easy, fast CSS developement...
- [DaisyUI] - Built upon Tailwind CSS, for easier and faster development ;)

### Client

- [Godot] - Godot game engine, but basically any engine will do the work... It's preffered because of the python-like programming language, GDScript!
